As the name suggests with each iteration the largest number pops up like a bubble in the water at its respective position in the sorted array. We swap corresponding positions starting from the initial index to the last. This results in the largest number being on the rightmost index. Repeat this for the $n-1$ pass and the array will be sorted. \n",
